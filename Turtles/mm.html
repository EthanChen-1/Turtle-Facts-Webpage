            Male mississippi map turtles can grow up to 5 inches and females double them in size growing up to 10 inches. <br/>
            They like to swim in turbulent water. <br/>
            Their most distinguishing feature is the saw like protrusions from the top of their shell, and the pattern of the shell is like that of the contour lines on a map. <br/>
            Their diets consist mostly of crustaceans like snails and clams. <br/>
            Mississippi map turtles can live up to 30 years in captivity.

            Make sure to fill up the water as much as possible, red ear sliders like to swim. <br/> 
            Water heater should be 74-83 degrees. You don't want your turtles to freeze but don't cook them either. <br/> 
            Don't use small pebbles for the substrate as mississippi map turtle will eat almost everything that fits into their mouth. <br/>
            Feed younger turtles once a day and feed adults every 2-3 days. <br/>
            Do water changes once a week with dechlorinated water. <br/>
            Don't handle them too much as they can die from the stress of being over-handled. <br/>
            Remember to replace UV bulbs every half a year. <br/>
