        <h3>How to care for your Red-Ear Slider</h3>
        <p>
            Place heat Bulb and UVA + UVB bulbs above basking platform. <br/>
            Make sure to fill up the water as much as possible, painted like to swim. <br/> 
            Water heater should be 74-83 degrees. You don't want your turtles to freeze but don't cook them either. <br/> 
            Don't use small pebbles for the substrate as painted turtles will eat almost everything that fits into their mouth. <br/>
            Feed younger turtles once a day and feed adults every 2-3 days. <br/>
            They don't like to be handled and can die from the stress acquired from over-handling. <br/>
            Do water changes once a week with dechlorinated water. <br/>
            Remember to replace UV bulbs every half a year. <br/>
