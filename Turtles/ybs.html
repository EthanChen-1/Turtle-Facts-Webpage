        Male yellow-bellied sliders can grow up to 9 inches long while females can grow up to 13 inches long. <br/>
        Closely related to <a href="/search?choice=res">red-ear sliders</a>. <br/>
        Easily identifiable by their dark shells with yellow bands going across the scutes and their yellow underside with black spots. <br/>
        This species is diurnal meaning they are most active during the day. <br/>
        Unlike the red-ear slider, yellow-bellied sliders do not carry the salmonella virus. <br/>
        Yellow-Bellied sliders can breathe through their butts in a process known as cloacal respiration. <br/>
        They are also able to breathe without much oxygen in a process called anerobic respiration. <br/>
        Yellow-Bellied sliders can live up to 40 years in captivity and in the wild. <br/>

    <h3>How to care for your Yellow-Bellied Slider</h3>
    <p>
        Place heat Bulb and UVA + UVB bulbs above basking platform. <br/>
        Make sure to fill up the water as much as possible, red ear sliders like to swim. <br/> 
        Water heater should be 74-83 degrees. You don't want your turtles to freeze but don't cook them either. <br/> 
        Don't use small pebbles for the substrate as yellow-bellied sliders will eat almost everything that fits into their mouth. <br/>
        Feed younger turtles once a day and feed adults every 2-3 days. <br/>
        Do water changes once a week with dechlorinated water. <br/>
        Don't handle them too much as they can die from the stress of being over-handled. <br/>
        Remember to replace UV bulbs every half a year. <br/>
