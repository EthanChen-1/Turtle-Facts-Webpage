            Red-ear slider's are one of the most invasive species of animals in the United States. <br/>
            Closely related to the <a href="search?choice=ybs">yellow-bellied slider</a>. <br/>
            Most red-ear sliders are average 6-8 inches in length with the bigger ones growing to 12+ inches. <br/>
            They are easily identifiable by their red patch near their ears. <br/>
            They are referred to as sliders because of how they appear to slide into water at any sign of danger. <br/>
            Red-ear sliders are able to "breathe" through their butts in a process known as cloacal respiration. <br/>
            This species is diurnal meaning they are most active during the day. <br/>
            They can also breathe without much oxygen in a process known as anerobic respiration. <br/>
            Red-ear sliders are omnivores with their diet consisting of insects, fish, and aquatic vegetation. <br/>
            They are carriers of salmonella so becareful when handling red-ear sliders. <br/>
            Lastly red-ear sliders can live upto 40 years in the wild.

        <h3>How to care for your Red-Ear Slider</h3>
        <p>
            Place heat Bulb and UVA + UVB bulbs above basking platform. <br/>
            Make sure to fill up the water as much as possible, red ear sliders like to swim. <br/> 
            Water heater should be 74-83 degrees. You don't want your turtles to freeze but don't cook them either. <br/> 
            Don't use small pebbles for the substrate as Red Ear Sliders will eat almost everything that fits into their mouth. <br/>
            Feed younger turtles once a day and feed adults every 2-3 days. <br/>
            They don't like to be handled and can die from the stress acquired from over-handling. <br/>
            Do water changes once a week with dechlorinated water. <br/>
            Remember to replace UV bulbs every half a year. <br/>
