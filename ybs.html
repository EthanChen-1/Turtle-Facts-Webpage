    <h3>How to care for your Yellow-Bellied Slider</h3>
    <p>
        Place heat Bulb and UVA + UVB bulbs above basking platform. <br/>
        Make sure to fill up the water as much as possible, red ear sliders like to swim. <br/> 
        Water heater should be 74-83 degrees. You don't want your turtles to freeze but don't cook them either. <br/> 
        Don't use small pebbles for the substrate as yellow-bellied sliders will eat almost everything that fits into their mouth. <br/>
        Feed younger turtles once a day and feed adults every 2-3 days. <br/>
        Do water changes once a week. <br/>
        Remember to replace UV bulbs every half a year. <br/>
